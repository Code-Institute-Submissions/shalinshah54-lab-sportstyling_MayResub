## UX Framework

### Strategy

The Sport Styling is an online e-com site with products to shop from by using front-end and back-end functionality, created using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Python and Django. The goal is to create a website that is user-friendly and allows users to easily search and buy so many products.

### Scope

The website is interactive and allows users to shop around see the products they like and easily add them to the cart. Once added to the cart if the shopper need to edit or delete the item from the cart they can easily do so.
Otherwise they can checkout and see there order confirmation. 

#### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements include: a user-friendly navigation menu, a search bar, properly display of products onclicking shop now button, working templates for registration, login. The product can be added to the card by choosing which product if it requires size then you can select that, you can select as much quantity you need. There is a add to cart buttton that can send your item to the shopping cart. On clicking on the cart buttton you can easily review your order make changes if needed otherwise safely click on checkout. Here you are redirected to the form page where the user has fill the information and the credit card info. And can place your order and see the confirmation on the next page with all your information added in the checkout form. 

#### Content Requirements

The content of the site should include a header and image, as well as a dropdown navigation menu. A search bar should allow users to search for prducts. There is my account link which allows to register and login. There is profile link which shows your history purchases. There is cart which redirects you to the checkout page. There is a checkout form where the user has to fill out and on checkout and order confirmation is given via email and the user can see it in the profile also. User can search the products by categories, by price, by alphabetical order or by Deals. The products are sorted accordingly. There is product management for the admin user where they can mannually enter the product to the site and remove the product if needed. They can change the price if there is a deal update images. 

### Structures

In this e-com site the main structure is to let the users come and shop for there sporting needs. They browse through the site and see all the different products and select them simply add them to the cart and checkout. Just add all the required info and checkout. The user can log back in and check there past history in the profile section. The super user is the only one who can add, edit and delete a product change its description and update the price.


### Skeleton

The skeleton of the website will utilise Bootstrap for the CSS layout of the pages, font awesome and google fonts are used. A dropdown navigation menu will allow users to go to their choose there category of items like to search for. The main landing page will function to allow users to select numerous products by click on shop now, and seeing the products and added them to your cart. Used the authall forms for registration and login. Stripe is used for the credit card varification and added the payment type. Webhook Handler are used if the user accidently closes the tab in the ordering process it still takes care of the order without any issues. Heroku is used for deployment and ASW for storing the static part of the site along with media. Crispy forms are used in the product management for adding, editing and updating data.

### Surface

The surface design of the website will also utilise bootstrap CSS to provide styling for the components of the website.
The first step for my research was visiting sites and knowing different layouts, elements in navigation bar, images, products there details and pricing which are stored in the product.json. Media folder holds all the needed images for the site.

### _Colors_ :

- Black
- White
- Grey
- Green
- Alert colors have been added like red, green, yellow and blue

### _Typography_ :

- Lato

 Google Fonts is used to style the text using the 'Lato' font used throughtout the site.

## Initial Deployment

This site was deployed to Heroku by following these steps:

1. Heroku needs to be told what the requirements are for this project, so go into your GitPod terminal, and create files to explain the requirements by using the following commands:
    * `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
    * `echo web: python run.py > Procfile` - Ensure there is no blank line after the contents of this file.
2. Push these changes to your repository.
3. Login or sign up to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
4. Select '**Create New App**' in the top right of your dashboard.
5. Choose a unique app name, and select the region closest to you, before clicking '**Create App**'.
6. Go to the '**Deploy**' tab, find '**Deployment Method**', and select '**GitHub**'.
7. Search to find your GitHub repository, and click '**Connect**'. Don't enable automatic deployment yet, as this can cause errors.
8. Go to the '**Settings**' tab, find '**Config Vars**', and click '**Reveal Config Vars**'.
9. Enter key-value pairs that match those in your project files, as shown above in [Environment Variables](#environment-variables).
10. In Heroku, go to the '**Resources**' tab, and add on '**Heroku Postgres**' with the free plan.
11. Make migrations to start using PostgreSQL by running `python3 manage.py makemigrations` then `python3 manage.py migrate`.
12. If it returns `django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL: role "xxxxxxxx" does not exist`, then run `unset PGHOSTADDR` in your terminal and run the commands in step 11 again.
13. Load the category and product fixtures by running `python3 manage.py loaddata categories`, then `python3 manage.py loaddata products`.
14. Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel by running `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` then following the instructions in the terminal.
15. Remove the DATABASE_URL from your environment variables or env.py file.
16. Install the Heroku CLI and log in using either `heroku login` or `heroku login -i`.
17. Run `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app shalinshah54@gmail.com`.
18. Run `git add .`, `git commit -m "Your commit message here"`, `git push`.
19. Add the hostname of your Heroku app to '**ALLOWED HOSTS**' in your settings.py file. This can be found in Heroku Settings > App Name.
20. Connect Heroku to Git using `git remote add heroku {your heroku git url}`.
21. If you'd like to automatically deploy to Heroku whenever you push to GitHub, do the following:
    * Go to the '**Deploy**' tab in Heroku, and click '**Enable Automatic Deployment**'.
    * In '**Manual Deploy**', choose which branch you'd like to deploy from (I chose '**main**' branch, this is sometimes '**master**').
    * Click '**Deploy Branch**' to deploy your app onto the Heroku servers.
    * Once the app has finished building, click '**Open App**' to open your site.
22. If you don't want to automatically deploy to Heroku, do the following:
    * Enter `git push -u heroku main` or `git push -u heroku master`.
23. Your app will now be running at **<https://{your-app-name}.herokuapp.com/>**

## Amazon AWS

### S3 Bucket

1. Create a new bucket, give it a name, and choose the region closest to you.
2. Go to '**Properties**', turn on static website hosting, and fill in `index.html` and `error.html` where it suggests.
3. Go to '**Permissions**', and add the code block underneath this section into your CORS config to link Heroku and your S3 bucket.
4. Still in '**Permissions**', go to '**Bucket Policy**', '**Edit**', '**Policy Generator**'.
5. In '**Select Type of Policy**' choose '**S3 Bucket Policy**'.
6. In '**Add Statements**', select '**Effect**' of `Allow`, enter `*` into '**Principal**', in '**Actions**' choose `GetObject`, enter your ARN from your main S3 Bucket page, and click '**Add Statement**'.
7. Then click '**Generate**', and copy and paste your generated policy into the Bucket Policy area.
8. Add `/*` at the end of the '**Resource**' line, and save.
9. Still in '**Permissions**', go to the '**Access Control List**', and select `List` next to '**Everyone**'.

```python
  [
    {
      "AllowedHeaders": [
        "Authorization"
      ],
      "AllowedMethods": [
        "GET"
      ],
      "AllowedOrigins": [
        "*"
      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
  ]
```

### IAM

1. Go to '**User Groups**', '**Create New Group**', enter a sensible name (I chose `manage-ms4-lead-shot-hazard`), and click '**Create**'.
2. Go to '**Policies**', '**Create New Policy**', '**JSON**', '**Import Managed Policy**', '**S3**', '**AmazonS3FullAccess**', '**Import**'.
3. Get your ARN from '**S3 Permissions**', delete the `*` from '**Resource**', and add the code block underneath this section into the area.
4. Click '**Next**', '**Review**', provide a name and description, and click '**Create Policy**'.
5. Go to '**User Groups**', '**Find New Group**', '**Permissions**', '**Add Permissions**', '**Attach Policies**', find the policy you created in steps 3 and 4, and click '**Add Permissions**'.
6. Go to '**Users**', provide a name, and tick the checkbox beside '**Access key - Programmatic access**'.
7. Click '**Next**', select the group you created in step 1, and click through to the end.
8. Finally, click '**Create User**', and download the CSV file, which will contain your `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`. This is the only time that this CSV file will be available, so it's very important to download it at this stage.

```python
"Resource": [
    "{YOUR ARN}",
    "{YOUR ARN}/*"
]
```

### Final AWS Steps

1. Remove the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` variable from your environment variables.
2. When you next deploy to Heroku, AWS will retrieve your static files and store them.
3. Go to S3, you'll see that you have a '**static**' folder with all your static files in it.
4. Create a '**media**' file in your S3 Bucket, click '**Upload**'.
5. Click '**Add Files**', then select all your product images.
6. Under '**Manage Public Permissions**', select '**Grant Public Read Access**'.
7. Then click through until you can click '**Upload**'.
8. Finally, attempt to log in to the site using the superuser details, then access the '**admin**' panel on the live site, go to '**Email Addresses**', and select Primary and Verified on the superuser email address.
